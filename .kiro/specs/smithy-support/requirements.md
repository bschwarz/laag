# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for adding AWS Smithy support to the laag library collection. Smithy is an interface definition language (IDL) and set of tools for building APIs. The implementation will follow the same design patterns and architecture as the existing OpenAPI and RAML packages, ensuring consistency across the laag ecosystem.

Smithy is increasingly important in the API ecosystem, particularly for AWS services, and adding support will make laag a more comprehensive solution for API specification management.

## Requirements

5. IF the package has dependencies THEN it SHALL depend on `@laag/core` as a workspace dependency
6. WHEN the package is published THEN it SHALL have `publishConfig.access` set to `"public"`
7. WHEN the package scripts are defined THEN they SHALL include build, test, lint, and type-check commands matching other packages

### Requirement 2: Core Smithy Class Implementation

6. WHEN validation fails THEN it SHALL return a `ValidationResult` with detailed error messages
7. WHEN validation succeeds THEN it SHALL return a `ValidationResult` with `isValid: true`

### Requirement 4: Shape Access and Manipulation

5. WHEN a structure shape is accessed THEN it SHALL provide methods to get members and their types
6. WHEN shapes are modified THEN it SHALL provide methods to add, update, and remove shapes
7. WHEN the model is serialized THEN it SHALL output valid Smithy JSON AST format

### Requirement 5: Trait Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to work with Smithy traits, so that I can add metadata and behavior to my API shapes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traits are accessed THEN it SHALL provide methods to get traits applied to a shape
2. WHEN traits are added THEN it SHALL validate trait definitions and applications
3. WHEN standard traits are used THEN it SHALL support common traits (http, httpError, required, etc.)
4. WHEN custom traits are defined THEN it SHALL allow custom trait definitions
5. IF a trait is invalid THEN it SHALL throw a validation error
6. WHEN traits are queried THEN it SHALL provide methods to check if a shape has a specific trait

### Requirement 6: Service and Operation Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to work with Smithy services and operations, so that I can define and manipulate API endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service is accessed THEN it SHALL provide methods to get service metadata (version, operations)
2. WHEN operations are listed THEN it SHALL return all operations defined in a service
3. WHEN an operation is accessed THEN it SHALL provide input, output, and error shapes
4. WHEN HTTP bindings are defined THEN it SHALL extract HTTP method, URI, and status codes from traits
5. WHEN operations are added THEN it SHALL validate operation structure and references
6. WHEN resources are defined THEN it SHALL support resource hierarchies and operations

### Requirement 7: Type System Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript types for Smithy models, so that I have type safety and IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN types are defined THEN they SHALL cover all Smithy shape types

5. WHEN the API is used THEN it SHALL provide full IntelliSense support in IDEs
6. WHEN types are exported THEN they SHALL be available from the package root

### Requirement 8: Code Generation Support
