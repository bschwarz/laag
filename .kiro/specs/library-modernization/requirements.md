# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for modernizing the laag library collection from its current JavaScript/CommonJS implementation to a modern TypeScript-based architecture. The modernization will leverage Bun for build tooling, package management, and testing while maintaining backward compatibility and improving developer experience, type safety, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the laag library, I want full TypeScript support so that I can benefit from type safety, better IDE support, and improved code documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import any laag package THEN the system SHALL provide complete TypeScript type definitions
2. WHEN I use any library method THEN the system SHALL provide compile-time type checking for parameters and return values
3. WHEN I build my project with TypeScript THEN the system SHALL not produce any type errors from laag imports
4. IF I use an IDE with TypeScript support THEN the system SHALL provide accurate autocomplete and inline documentation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the laag library, I want to use Bun as the primary build tool and package manager so that I can have faster builds, simpler configuration, and unified tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run build commands THEN the system SHALL use Bun for compilation and bundling
2. WHEN I install dependencies THEN the system SHALL use Bun package manager instead of npm
3. WHEN I run tests THEN the system SHALL use Bun's built-in test runner
4. WHEN I manage the monorepo THEN the system SHALL support Bun workspaces for package management
5. IF I need to publish packages THEN the system SHALL generate proper CommonJS and ESM outputs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer consuming laag packages, I want modern module support (ESM) while maintaining backward compatibility so that I can use the library in both legacy and modern projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import using ESM syntax THEN the system SHALL provide native ESM modules
2. WHEN I require using CommonJS syntax THEN the system SHALL provide CommonJS compatibility
3. WHEN I use the library in Node.js THEN the system SHALL work with both module systems
4. WHEN I bundle for browsers THEN the system SHALL provide tree-shakeable ESM exports

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a contributor to the laag project, I want modern development tooling and practices so that I can write better code with consistent formatting, linting, and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write code THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent formatting with Prettier
2. WHEN I commit code THEN the system SHALL run ESLint checks for TypeScript
3. WHEN I write tests THEN the system SHALL use modern testing patterns with Bun test
4. WHEN I submit a PR THEN the system SHALL run automated type checking, linting, and tests
5. IF I use VS Code THEN the system SHALL provide proper workspace configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want to preserve existing API compatibility while improving the internal architecture so that existing users can upgrade without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing users upgrade THEN the system SHALL maintain the same public API surface
2. WHEN users import classes and methods THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as before
3. WHEN users access extension methods THEN the system SHALL continue to work with x-* properties
4. IF users rely on specific method signatures THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
5. WHEN users upgrade THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration documentation for any breaking changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with API specifications, I want improved error handling and validation so that I can debug issues more effectively and catch problems early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I pass invalid data to library methods THEN the system SHALL provide clear, typed error messages
2. WHEN I work with malformed specifications THEN the system SHALL validate input and provide helpful feedback
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL include context about what went wrong and how to fix it
4. IF I use TypeScript THEN the system SHALL catch type mismatches at compile time
5. WHEN I debug issues THEN the system SHALL provide source maps for better stack traces

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a package consumer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples so that I can quickly understand how to use the modernized library effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript examples for all major use cases
2. WHEN I need API reference THEN the system SHALL generate documentation from TypeScript types
3. WHEN I want to migrate THEN the system SHALL provide clear upgrade guides from the old version
4. WHEN I explore examples THEN the system SHALL include both CommonJS and ESM usage patterns
5. IF I need specific functionality THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive JSDoc comments with type information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer building applications, I want to use the laag library in both browser and Node.js environments so that I can work with API specifications across different platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the library in a browser THEN the system SHALL provide browser-compatible bundles
2. WHEN I use the library in Node.js THEN the system SHALL work with Node.js-specific features
3. WHEN I bundle for web applications THEN the system SHALL support tree-shaking and produce minimal bundle sizes
4. WHEN I use the library in different environments THEN the system SHALL handle platform-specific differences gracefully
5. IF I need CLI functionality THEN the system SHALL provide command-line tools that work across platforms

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline, I want reliable and fast automated testing so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL execute all tests using Bun test runner
2. WHEN I check coverage THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive test coverage reports
3. WHEN I run type checking THEN the system SHALL validate TypeScript types across all packages
4. WHEN I build packages THEN the system SHALL verify both CommonJS and ESM outputs work correctly
5. IF any test fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and exit with proper codes
